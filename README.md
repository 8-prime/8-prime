## My goals

I love to develop tooling in any form. Typically airsing from small annoyances I encounter in day to day life.
There are too many things that should be a *solved problemâ„¢*â€‹ . 
Whenever I get the change to actually solve one of those things I try to make an effort to build something that will at least solve my issues.
